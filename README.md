This retro looking website was made using **only** HTML.

This website was created as a "capstone project" during ["The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course by dr. Angela Yu from [The App Brewery](https://appbrewery.com/).
